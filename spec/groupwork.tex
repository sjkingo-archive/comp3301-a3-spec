\subsection*{Group work}

If you decide to work in groups of two, \textbf{one} member of the group should
e-mail the tutor (or if unavailable the lecturer) \textbf{no later than seven
days before the due date}.  After this cutoff it will be assumed that you are
working individually and you will be marked as such. Both members of a
group will receive the same mark, and any complaints or problems should be
directed to the lecturer who will treat each case confidentially.

The tutor and lecturer's e-mail addresses can be found on the course website.

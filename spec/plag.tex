As part of the assessment you must also answer some short--response questions
that will test your understanding of the concepts that you have implemented.

This assignment may be completed \textbf{individually} or in
\textbf{self-selected groups of two}. Please read the section on group work if
you decide to work in groups of two. Although you may share code with your team
member (if working in groups of two), it is still considered cheating to look
at another student's code or allow your code to be seen or copied. You should
be aware that all code submitted may be subject to automated checks by
plagiarism-detection software.  You should read and understand the school's
policy on student misconduct, which is available at:
\url{http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/about_ITEE/policies/student-misconduct.html}.

\subsection*{Coding style}

Your solution must conform to the Linux kernel coding style document available
at \url{http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle} (or
\texttt{Documentation/CodingStyle} in the kernel source tree). You may wish to
run your code through the \texttt{checkpatch} tool to validate that your
solution adheres to the coding style. The following arguments may be useful to
you (where \texttt{FILE} is the C source file you wish to check):

\begin{verbatim}
checkpatch --no-tree --no-signoff -f --no-summary FILE
\end{verbatim}

The tool is available to download from
\url{http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/apw/checkpatch/checkpatch.pl-0.29}.

You may also find the \texttt{indent(1)} tool useful with the following arguments:

\begin{verbatim}
indent -kr -i8 FILE
\end{verbatim}

Please note that these are tools only --- they should not be considered
perfect. Always double-check the results by hand to be sure.

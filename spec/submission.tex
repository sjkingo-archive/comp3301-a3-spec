\subsection*{Submission and Version Control}

The due date for this assignment is \textbf{\duedate}. Submission made after
this time will incur a 10\% penalty per day late (weekends are counted as 1
day). Any submissions more than 4 days late will receive 0 marks. No extensions 
will be given without supporting documentation (i.e.  medical certificate or
family emergency)---should such a situation occur you should e-mail the course
coordinator as soon as possible.

This assignment must be submitted through ITEE's Subversion system (you should
already be familiar with this from previous courses). You should ensure all of
your source files (including any \texttt{.h} files if you have created them)
and \texttt{Makefile} are committed to the repository under the following URL
(where \textit{s4123456} is your student number):

\url{https://svn.itee.uq.edu.au/repo/comp3301-s4123456/\assignnum}

Submissions will be retrieved from your repository when the due date has been
reached.  Your submission time will be taken as the most recent revision in the 
above repository directory.

You are required to make regular commits to your repository as a demonstration
of your work. Subversion history will be considered in marking.

For information regarding ITEE's Subversion system, see
\url{http://studenthelp.itee.uq.edu.au/faq/subversion/}.

Answers to the short-response questions should be provided in a \texttt{responses.txt}
file in the specified repository directory.
